To Do

1. Detection read calls...
- On flow, flare, rootstock - get overall gas spent in 3 months
- On Polygon - see if user has toucan NCT token
Use:
Blockscout
(Best use of Blockscout ⸺ $6,000, Best Blockscout SDK Integration ⸺ $3,000, Big Blockscout Explorer Pool Prize ⸺ $10,000)

2. Calculation of carbon emissions
Could use:
On Flow: offchain
(only if time allows) On Flare: FDC (Flare Data Connector) for Web3 and Web2 data sources. We need a web2 API... But we can make a dummy API.. i.e. serve the data ourselves, create a dummy gist that just exposes a JSON. Avoid putting this in our server so we can use nextjs serverless for super fast deploy.
(MAIN TRACK: use protocols on Flare blockchain ⸺ $8,000 & BONUS TRACK: external data source or cross chain application ⸺ $2,000)

3. Bridge from flow, flare
To polygon and buy Toucan NCT token.. layerswap (vlayer doesn't support the chains)
https://blog.toucan.earth/announcing-nct-nature-carbon-tonne/
Could use:
Layerzero
(lzRead Track ⸺ $4,000, Composability Track ⸺ $4,000, General Prize Track ⸺ $2,000)
Within Layerzero setup, use 1inch API for the swaps (Utilize 1inch APIs ⸺ $1,500)



4. Dashboard - find a frontend react library for cool visuals
We will display:
Flow/Flare Tx history bar chart (gas spent for each tx)
Flow/Flare Tx history bar chart (carbon emitted for each tx)
Polygon NCT amount
Amount offset (Blockscout green credits)


5. Dashboard - Blockscout green credits, find a frontend react library for cool visuals
Could use:
(Best Blockscout Merits (points) Use Case ⸺ $1,000)

6. (only if time allows) Tx flow with EIP7824 - Use Yellow to store the amount and buy the carbon credits at a time when gas is lower
(Best Use of ERC-7824 and Nitro Protocol ⸺ $10,000)
